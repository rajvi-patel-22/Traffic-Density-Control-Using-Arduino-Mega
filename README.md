# Traffic-Density-Control-Using-Arduino-Mega
This project deals with the increasing traffic problems in cities. We decided to work on this topic due to the following reasons :- Reducing traffic congestion, reducing long time delay, keeps track of vehicles and many more. Also we have seen that due to traffic emergency vehicles (ambulance,fire brigade) get delayed to reach on time.We will use IR sensors to sense the limit of the maximum vehicles. The sensors will send the signal to the microcontroller. It will compare which road has the highest density of vehicles and will send the signal to open that particular road for crossing. Thus, reducing the traffic. We are also using sound detecting sensors. Whenever it detects sound in form of siren for any emergency vehicle(like ambulance, fire brigade). These sensors will also send signal to microcontroller to make that signal green , so that the emergency vehicle can pass easily and takes less time.There is also a temperature sensor that can sense the temperature and display it on LCD display. These two are also connected with microcontroller .
